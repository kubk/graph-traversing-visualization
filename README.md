# kubk/graph-traversing-visualization

Graph representation/manipulation/traversal visualization using vanilla JavaScript + Canvas API.

Check out [demo in your browser](https://kubk.github.io/graph-traversing-visualization/).

## Features
- Draggable vertices
- Directed (one-way)/Undirected (two-way)/Parallel edges
- Dynamic building of adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, adjacency list
- Deleting vertices (with all connected edges)
- Depth/Breadth-first search visualization
- Object-oriented

## Control
- Create vertex - Left mouse click on empty space
- Drag vertex - Press and hold down left mouse button, then move drag vertex to the desired location
- Connect vertices - Right mouse click on start/end vertex
- Delete vertex - Ctrl+right mouse click
- Set vertex as selected (for specifying start vertex of search algorithms) - Ctrl+left mouse click
